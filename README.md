## The Console

**The Command interpreter**
In our project, the console serves as a robust utility for data management, allowing you to create a flexible data model. With this console, you can efficiently handle object operations such as creation, updating, and deletion through a command interpreter.

_**Key Features**_

- Create, modify, and delete objects
- Store & Persist Objects to a ```json``` file

## Deployment

To deploy the command interpreter run:

```bash
  $ ./console.py

  (hbnb) 
```

To use the command interpreter, simply type in any of these commands: ```create```, ```update```, ```delete``` to manipulate objects, and ```help``` to see all the available commands to utilize
